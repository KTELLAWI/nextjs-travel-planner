Those were not just movie-sets, but a UNESCO recognised World Heritage Site- the ruins of an ancient city- Petra in Jordan.\nPetra enjoys a fortress-like protection by the towering rocks around it. It has an entrance from the east, barely 10 feet wide, called the Siq, which was formed of a crevice in the sandstone rocks. The first structure from this side is the Treasury building, created by modifying a cliff. A little further lies the amphitheatre cut into the sandstone mountain and enclosed on three sides by natural pink walls. The tombs have facades inspired by Roman temples and semi-circular Syrian arches.\nIt is the most visited tourist attraction in Jordan and has found a place in the new 2007 list of the Seven Wonders of the World.",

It has an entrance from the east, barely 10 feet wide, called the Siq, which was formed of a crevice in the sandstone rocks. The first structure from this side is the Treasury building, created by modifying a cliff. A little further lies the amphitheatre cut into the sandstone mountain and enclosed on three sides by natural pink walls. The tombs have facades inspired by Roman temples and semi-circular Syrian arches.\nIt is the most visited tourist attraction in Jordan and has found a place in the new 2007 list of the Seven Wonders of the World.",

It was here, at this hilltop fortified palace overlooking the Dead Sea region and the distant hills of Palestine and Israel that Herod imprisoned and beheaded John the  Baptist. He was beheaded after Salomes fateful dance. (Matthew 14:3-11), Proceed onwards to The baptismal site of Jesus Christ (Bethany beyond Jordan).where John the Baptist prepared the way for the arrival of the Messiah, and John's ministry itself marked the beginning of the preaching of \"the gospel of the Kingdom of God\" (Luke 16:16). Some of the pivotal events in John's life and his  heralding of the coming of Jesus took place in Jordan. Though Jesus  Christ's divinely inspired role was announced before and during His birth, He launched His public ministry at Bethany beyond the Jordan at age 30, immediately after He was baptized by John and anointed by  God (Luke 3:21-23, Acts 1:21-22).

It has an entrance from the east, barely 10 feet wide, called the Siq, which was formed of a crevice in the sandstone rocks. The first structure from this side is the Treasury building, created by modifying a cliff. A little further lies the amphitheatre cut into the sandstone mountain and enclosed on three sides by natural pink walls. The tombs have facades inspired by Roman temples and semi-circular Syrian arches.\nIt is the most visited tourist attraction in Jordan and has found a place in the new 2007 list of the Seven Wonders of the World.",

Those were not just movie-sets, but a UNESCO recognised World Heritage Site- the ruins of an ancient city- Petra in Jordan.\nPetra enjoys a fortress-like protection by the towering rocks around it. It has an entrance from the east, barely 10 feet wide, called the Siq, which was formed of a crevice in the sandstone rocks. The first structure from this side is the Treasury building, created by modifying a cliff. A little further lies the amphitheatre cut into the sandstone mountain and enclosed on three sides by natural pink walls. The tombs have facades inspired by Roman temples and semi-circular Syrian arches.\nIt is the most visited tourist attraction in Jordan and has found a place in the new 2007 list of the Seven Wonders of the World.",
